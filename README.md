# Machine Learning Notebooks

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Notebooks** repository! This repository is designed to provide a collection of practical machine learning projects. Each project is organized into folders, each containing:

- **Data**: The dataset used for the project (in `.csv` or other formats).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: A step-by-step explanation and implementation of the project in a `.ipynb` file.
- **Requirements File**: A `requirements.txt` file listing the necessary Python libraries to run the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required libraries for each project by using the `requirements.txt` file provided in each folder.

To install the dependencies, navigate to the folder of the project you want to run and use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Running the Notebooks

1. Open the folder of the project you want to explore.
2. Install the required libraries as mentioned in the **Prerequisites** section.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook by running:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open the .ipynb file and run the cells to follow along with the project.

## Folder Structure

Each folder follows the same structure:

```
project-folder/
│
├── data/                   # Dataset used for the project
│   └── data-file.csv        # Example dataset file
│
├── notebook.ipynb           # Jupyter notebook implementing the project
│
└── requirements.txt         # List of dependencies to install
```

Example Folder:

```
linear-regression/
│
├── data/
│   └── house_prices.csv
│
├── linear_regression.ipynb
│
└── requirements.txt

```
